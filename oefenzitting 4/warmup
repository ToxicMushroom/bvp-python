1. explain why it is important to specify the precondition and postcondition of an algorithm
You always need something to proof, we want to proof that for a precondition and postcondition that the algorithm works.

2. What is an invariant ? Why do you need it ?
A condition that must be true after every loop and is correct just before the loop gets executed.
it is needed to proof the post-condition

3. How so you find an invariant ?
You want a condition that includes all the variables and that is true for every iteration of the while loop.

4. Why do you need to prove finiteness if you have already proven the steps related to the invariant (Steps 3.1-4)?
So that we know if we ever leave the while loop and that we get to our postcondition.

5. How does a variant help to prove finiteness ?
it shows a monotone decrease so we get closer to the stopcondition

6. How do you find a variant ?
Choose a condition that shows a monotone progression towards the stopcondition
